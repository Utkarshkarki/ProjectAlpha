📦 What is fnlwgt?
The fnlwgt (final weight) stands for final sampling weight. It comes from how the U.S. Census Bureau samples and scales individuals to represent the entire U.S. population.

It’s a numerical column used during survey design to indicate how representative each person is in the dataset.

🧮 What does it mean practically?
If fnlwgt = 1000, it means this person represents 1000 similar people in the U.S. population.

So two people might have the same age, job, and income — but different fnlwgt values — because one is more statistically representative than the other based on how the sample was drawn.

📊 Why Does the Census Use It?
The U.S. Census uses stratified sampling: sampling certain groups more or less heavily based on demographics.

fnlwgt is used to rebalance the sample so it better reflects the true population proportions.

🧠 Should You Use fnlwgt in Your ML Model?
✅ Use it only if:
You're doing population-level statistics, e.g., “how many Americans make over $50K.”

You're building a weighted model that mimics the real-world population.

🚫 Usually don't use it if:
You're doing pure predictive modeling (e.g., to predict income for individuals).

You're training models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, etc. where weights
can introduce unnecessary noise.

 __pycache__ — is automatically generated by Python whenever you import or run Python files.

🔍 What is __pycache__?
It stores compiled bytecode versions of your .py files — with a .pyc extension.

These are created to speed up execution the next time you run the code.

Instead of re-parsing and re-interpreting the Python source, Python just loads the already-compiled bytecode.

🧠 Why does it get generated?
When you import or run a Python module, Python compiles it to bytecode (a lower-level, optimized version of the code).

This bytecode is stored in __pycache__ so Python can execute it faster next time.

For example, if you have a file data_ingestion.py, Python might generate:

bash
Copy
Edit
__pycache__/data_ingestion.cpython-311.pyc
🧼 Can you delete __pycache__?
Yes, it's safe to delete — Python will just regenerate it next time the script runs. But it's usually best to leave it as-is unless you're cleaning up for packaging or version control.

✅ TL;DR:
__pycache__ is a built-in Python optimization folder that stores compiled versions of your .py files to make your scripts run faster.
